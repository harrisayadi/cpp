## Review Questions

Q1. Explain the difference between overloading a function and redefining a function.

There is a distinction between redefining a function and overloading a function. An overloaded function is one with the same name as one or more other functions, but with a different
parameter list. The compiler uses the arguments passed to the function to tell which version to call. Overloading can take place with regular functions that are not members of a
class. Overloading can also take place inside a class when two or more member functions of the same class have the same name. These member functions must have different parameter
lists for the compiler to tell them apart in function calls.

Redefining happens when a derived class has a function with the same name as a base class function. The parameter lists of the two functions can be the same because the derived class
function is always called by objects of the derived class type.

Q2. Explain the difference between static binding and dynamic binding.

Binding means the process of matching the function call with the correct function. 

The key difference is that 
- static binding is done during compiling time. 
- dynamical binding is done at runtime.

Q4. What will the following program display?
``` cpp
#include <iostream.>
using namespace std;
class First
{
  protected:
    int a;
  public:
    First(int x = 1)
    { a = x; }
    int getVal()
    { return a; }
 };
 
class Second : public First
{
  private:
    int b;
  public:
    Second(int y = 5)
    { b = y; }
    int getVal()
    { return b; }
};

int main()
{
First object1;
Second object2;
cout << object1.getVal() << endl;
cout << object2.getVal() << endl;
return 0;
}
```

Q6. What will the following program display?
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class First
{
protected:
  int a;
public:
  First(int x = 1)
  { a = x; }
  virtual void twist()
  { a *= 2; }
  int getVal()
  { twist(); return a; }
};

class Second : public First
{
private:
  int b;
public:
  Second(int y = 5)
  { b = y; }
  virtual void twist()
  { b *= 10; }
};

int main()
{
First object1;
Second object2;
cout << object1.getVal() << endl;
cout << object2.getVal() << endl;
return 0;
}
```

``` cpp

2
1
```

Some Explanation：The reason why 1 is output from `object2.getVal()` is due to the overriden `twist` function in object2. `object2.getVal()` will activate the 

```
  virtual void twist()
  { b *= 10; }
```
, and there is no effect on variable `a`, which means that `a` remains to be 1.

Q7. What will the following program display?
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base
{
protected:
  int baseVar;
public:
  Base(int val = 2)
  { baseVar = val; }
  int getVar()
  { return baseVar; }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
private:
  int derivedVar;
public:
  Derived(int val = 100)
  { derivedVar = val; }
  int getVar()
  { return derivedVar; }
};

int main()
{
Base *optr = nullptr;
Derived object;
optr = &object;
cout << optr->getVar() << endl;
return 0;
}
```

``` cpp

2
```

Some Explanation：This is a tricky question. Something we need to pay attention to here:

- `getVar()` member function in the Base class is not a virtual function, thus cannot be overidden. In this case, dynamically bounding cannot be conducted. 
- optr is of type `Base`

So the `getVar()` of the Base class will be called, giving us 2 instead of 100. If you add `virtual` keyword to the `getVar()` function in the Base class, you will get 100 instead.
